10/11  5:00pm  3:00  Implemented most of the functions except for the
                     merge and closest algorithms. Debugged some of the
                     first test cases.
10/12  7:00pm  2:00  Implemented merge algortihm and began debugging issues
                     with some of the elements from src not being merged
                     into dest.
10/13  5:00pm  3:00  Implemented closest approach and finished debugging
                     merge seg faults using gdb in vscode. Implemented GPS
10/14  4:00pm  4:00  Debbugged each public test case one by one through
                     extensive use of gdb. Rewrote parts of GPS after
                     discovering that the file reading process was causing
                     seg faults. Resolved valgrind memory leak errors.

I mostly struggled with debugging the code in order to find problematic parts
of my algorithms. I initially started doing this using gdb through the console
but found that I could debug much faster if I used vscode's user interface
tool for gdb. After learning how to set up and use the gdb UI tool, I was able 
to resolve bugs at a faster rate and satisfy the test cases one by one.

I also struggled with trying to implement a merge algorithm that only runs in
O(k), so I ended up settling with my slightly slower implementation that
first iterates through the first "m" nodes in dest until the src timestamp is
less than the dest, which is when the merging begins. I did, however, save
time complexity by concatenating the rest of src onto dest when reaching the
end of dest with src nodes still remaning to be merged.
